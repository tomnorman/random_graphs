# Probability on Graphs

A tool to help understand probability on graphs.

## Graph (G)

Implemented with a matrix (G.mat)
The vertices ([V]) are numbered from zero, so:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\forall i, j \in [V]:">

* if i == j: node i weight

* else: weight of edge from i to j, zero if no edge.

G.mat is symmetric.

## Algorithms
